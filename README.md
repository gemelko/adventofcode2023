I've done Advent of Code (AoC) in other programming environments/languages in the past.
When I started this year (2023) I knew nothing about Rust.
I expect these are non-optimal solutions, but each arrives at the correct answer for AoC.
I know there are probably better ways to solve most of these problems.
I know that I'm likely programming in Rust like a toddler :D

Comments/feedback appreciated but not required.
